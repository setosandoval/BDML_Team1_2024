# Repository: Problem Sets Team 1 - Big Data and Machine Learning

This repository contains the solutions for the Problem Sets in the Big Data and Machine Learning course (2024-20). The project was developed by Team 1, composed of:
- Sergio Sandoval
- María Fernanda Blanco
- Juan Fernando Barberi
- Juan Eduardo Gutiérrez

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three folders, each corresponding to a specific problem set.

Within each folder, you will find:

- `document`: the final report in `pdf` format.
- `scripts`: all the R `code` used to solve the problem set.
- `stores`: the `datasets` used for analysis.
- `views`: all generated figures and tables.

Each folder also includes its own `README`, providing detailed information about the respective problem set.
